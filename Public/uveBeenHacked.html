        <p>If you can see this page it's because you have a vunerability in your site, likely an xss attack, and I have redirected you to this page. Although I have used this to show you a picture of a cat, other people can use it to gain access to different users' accounts or spoof a fake site which steals users' credentials and/or money. Please fix this, if you have any questions contact me at contact@JosephWitten.com</p>
